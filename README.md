Data analysis on factors affecting train turnaround times.

The first bunch of code blocks were used to fill in the missing arrival times and calculate the turnaround times.

After this a correlation analysis is done between numerous variables and turnaround time.
Then a number of plots are created to investigate the relationship of the variables with a significant correlation with turnaround time.

Then percentages are calculated for different conditions and planned turnaround times in order to find robust turnaround times

The final 2 code blocks were used to proof the existence of unknown variables impacting the turnaround times in the data, as is discussed in the discussion part of the thesis paper.
